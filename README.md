1. We used a lot of logic to talk out what needed to happen, also referenced previous project and worked with a mentor to create an inheritance class ~neat stuff~.

2. Iteration 4, curious as to what the logic would look like. Continuing to look for and reradicate bugs.

3. A lot of driver/navigator and some a-synchronous work.

4. Carrier pigeon.
